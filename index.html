            <p>Hi there! We hope our visit gave you a glimpse into college and computer science. 
                We wanted to share resources to help you explore both computer science and different future pathways.</p> 
            <p>Instead of just listing resources, we thought the best way to share them was by 
                showing what you can create with computer science!</p> 
            <p>In fact, we built this very website just for that purpose.</p> 
            <p>There was one thing we could not cover during our visit, so we dedicated a whole page to itâ€”answering the questions 
                you submitted in our questionnaire. We've answered every question and included helpful resources 
                to help you explore and learn more!</p>
